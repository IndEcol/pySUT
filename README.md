# pySUT - a new start


Python class for efficient handling of supply and use tables (SUTs)

This is currently under active development - stay tuned!

## A new start


This is a new beginning of the project.

The previous (2014-2018), numpy based version are archived at the branch "numpy_based_core".

## Development plans:

These are currently [discussed in an issue thread
here](https://github.com/IndEcol/pySUT/issues/10#issue-971800311)

General consensus so far:

- Pandas based
- Class for SUT gathering Use and Supply
- Class can handle coefficients or flows

## Documentation

We keep the documentation in the readme, issues and docstrings for now. Later on we 
will setup mkdocs for some github pages documentation.
